                   MicroEMACS 3.10e8+a

The following changes and extensions have been made to MicroEmacs.
Versions that contain these changes are identified by a '+a' on the
version number displayed on the mode line; eg MicroEMACS 3.10e8+a.
Most changes are transparent and extend the behavior over the
"standard" version.  Some behavior modifications have been made to
bring the behavior closer to other versions of emacs.  Standard 
MicroEMACS notation is used: M means the escape key, press and
release before the next key.  ^ means hold down the control key and
the following key, eg ^X means press both the control key and the X
key at the same time.


Behavior Changes:

String searches are now case sensitive by default.  The old mode
EXACT has been removed and replaced by ICASE.  If you want to use
case insensitive searches, use the add-mode ICASE (M-X add-mode icase)
command or put the line "add-mode icase" in your emacs rc file.

Versions with +a are a little more intelligent deciding what is a 
word.  Things like $12.30 are now considered words.

Twiddle characters (^T) will now ALWAYS twiddle the preceding two
characters.


Extensions:

Twiddle words (M-T) will twiddle preceding two words.

Twiddle lines (M-^T) will interchange the current and previous line

Reg-expr-search (M-/) will search for a regular expression.  This is
case sensitive unless ICASE mode is in effect.  Reverse-reg-exp-search
will do the same, except from the cursor to the beginning of the file.
This command is not bound to a key.  Note these commands remove the
requirement of setting MAGIC mode before searches.

Multiple kill buffers are now supported.  This is a circular list
(that's why it's called a killring) with a maximum of eight items
as currently configured.  A number of commands go along with this.

Display-kill-ring will display the contents of the killring with an
arrow pointing to the current item in a window.  Use ^X-O ^X-1 to
get rid of the window (that's ctrl-X, letter o).  This command is not
bound to a key, use M-X display-kill-ring to execute it.

Yank-previous (bound to ^X-^Y) will yank the previous item in the ring. 
Giving an argument (M-3 ^X ^Y) will yank the nth previous item back.

Index-kill-ring (M-^I) moves the kill ring pointer back by its argument
value (default 1).  It doesn't do anything to your file, but the next yank
will get back something different.  A message will appear in the bottom
miniwindow telling you what item you're on and showing the first few characters.

Kill-this-yank-that (M-Y) is my favorite though.  If you've yanked 
something and its not what you want, just M-Y and it gets killed
and the previous item becomes the current kill buffer and it's yanked.
You can index through the entire kill ring this way.  An argument
will yank the nth previous kill in the ring.

To change the termination key for searches from escape to return, put the line
    set $sterm ~n
into your emacs rc file.

To prevent the entire screen from scrolling when your line gets too long,
put the line
    set $hscroll 0
in your emacs rc file.  If you do this, only the affected line will scroll.

The write-file command (^X-^W) will use the default filename if you
hit a return at the Write file: prompt.

If you want ^<space> to be a space, put the following line in your rc file:
  bind-to-key space FNN 
A side effect of this is that the down arrow key will no longer work.
Note: This is only for some systems (eg DEC) where ^<space> is mapped to
      a function type key.

NOTE:  The rc file is called .emacsrc on Ultrix and emacs.rc on VMS.
       It lives in your home directory.
