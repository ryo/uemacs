See the file extensions.doc for a user-level description of the extensions
I've made.

See amaranth.c for technical comments relating to the extensions.  This is
also where the bulk of the code is, although some changes have been sprinkled
through the rest.

Files with an extension of .orig are, as far as I know, the original 3.10e
release files.  I got this version off of irisa in france, so modules that
were changed from .orig that I later modified have a .fr extension on them.
(this is confusing - my changes are in the .c files, the previous version
is .fr and the original is .orig - I think.)

You really only need the .c and .h files to make a working version.  I
have successfully made versions for Ultrix, VMS and the PC.  I do not see
any problem with other systems, although please let me know if you run
into any.

You will want to rename ebind.h.standard to ebind.h for your system.  We
have to modify the bindings because it is difficult to use ^S and ^Q
over our network.
