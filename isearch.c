/*
 * The functions in this file implement commands that perform incremental
 * searches in the forward and backward directions.  This "ISearch" command
 * is intended to emulate the same command from the original EMACS
 * implementation (ITS).  Contains references to routines internal to
 * SEARCH.C.
 *
 * REVISION HISTORY:
 *
 *	D. R. Banks 9-May-86
 *	- added ITS EMACSlike ISearch
 *
 *	John M. Gamble 5-Oct-86
 *	- Made iterative search use search.c's scanner() routine.
 *	  This allowed the elimination of bakscan().
 *	- Put isearch constants into estruct.h
 *	- Eliminated the passing of 'status' to scanmore() and
 *	  checknext(), since there were no circumstances where
 *	  it ever equalled FALSE.
 *	Dan Corkill 6-Oct-87
 *      - Changed character loop to terminate with extended characters
 *        (thus arrow keys, and most commands behave intuitively).
 *      - Changed META to be reread rather than simply aborting.
 *      - Conditionalized VMS alternates for ^S and ^Q to only apply
 *        to VMS ports.  (Allowing ^X as a synonym for ^S defeats some
 *        of the benefits of the first change above.)

/*
 * Subroutine to do an incremental search.  In general, this works similarly
 * to the older micro-emacs search function, except that the search happens
 * as each character is typed, with the screen and cursor updated with each
 * new search character.
 *
 * While searching forward, each successive character will leave the cursor
 * at the end of the entire matched string.  Typing a Control-S
 * will cause the next occurrence of the string to be searched for (where the
 * next occurrence does NOT overlap the current occurrence).  A Control-R will
 * change to a backwards search, META will terminate the search and Control-G
 * will abort the search.  Rubout will back up to the previous match of the
 * string, or if the starting point is reached first, it will delete the
 * last character from the search string.
 *
 * While searching backward, each successive character will leave the cursor
 * at the beginning of the matched string.  Typing a Control-R will search
 * backward for the next occurrence of the string.  Control-S
 * will revert the search to the forward direction.  In general, the reverse
 * incremental search is just like the forward incremental search inverted.
 *
 * In all cases, if the search fails, the user will be feeped, and the search
 * will stall until the pattern string is edited back into something that
 * exists (or until the search is aborted).
